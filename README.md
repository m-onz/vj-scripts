# vj-scripts

helpful scripts for generating visuals and VJing mainly with [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## aside running the scripts

Copy the code \*.pde code into the processing editor and save, if you download and run this folder directly the processing editor will complain about the containing folder not being named the same as the file thats running. I didn't want to have a folder full of folders containing single or sparse files.
